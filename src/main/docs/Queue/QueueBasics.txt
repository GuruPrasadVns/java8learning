Queue is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed for storing data.

The order is First In First Out (FIFO).

One can imagine a queue as a line of people waiting to receive something in sequential order which starts from the
beginning of the line.

It is an ordered list in which insertions are done at one end which is known as the rear and deletions are done from
the other end known as the front.

Basic Operations on Queue:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    enqueue(): Inserts an element at the end of the queue i.e. at the rear end.
    dequeue(): This operation removes and returns an element that is at the front end of the queue.
    front(): This operation returns the element at the front end without removing it.
    rear(): This operation returns the element at the rear end without removing it.
    isEmpty(): This operation indicates whether the queue is empty or not.
    isFull(): This operation indicates whether the queue is full or not.
    size(): This operation returns the size of the queue i.e. the total number of elements it contains.

Types of Queues:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    * Simple Queue
    * Circular Queue
    * Priority Queue
    * Dequeue
