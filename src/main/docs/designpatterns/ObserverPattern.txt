Meet The Observer Pattern
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	You know how newspaper or magazine subscriptions work
		->	A newspaper publisher goes into the business and begin publishing newspapers.
		->	You subscribe to a particular publisher and every time there is a new edition of newspaper it gets
			delivered to you. As long as you are the subscriber you get new newspaper.
		->	When you don't want papers any more you unsubscribe and they stop the newspaper delivery.
		->	While the publisher and other subscriber are remain in the business and they subscribe and unsubscribe
			newspaper.
	
	Publisher + Subscriber    =     Observer Pattern
	
If you understand newspaper subscriptions, you pretty much understand the Observer Pattern, only we call publisher the
SUBJECT and the subscriber the OBSERVERS.


Definition

all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
